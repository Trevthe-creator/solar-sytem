      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>    Our solar system includes the Sun, eight planets, five officially named dwarf planets, hundreds of moons, and thousands of asteroids and comets.
        <br> Our solar system is located in the Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy with two major arms, and two minor arms. 
        <br>Our Sun is in a small, partial arm of the Milky Way called the Orion Arm, or Orion Spur, between the Sagittarius and Perseus arms.
        <br> Our solar system orbits the center of the galaxy at about 515,000 mph (828,000 kph).
        <br> It takes about 230 million years to complete one orbit around the galactic center.

<h2> Formation and Evolution</h2>
<div= class="container"></div>
<p> 
	Past Diagram of the early Solar System's protoplanetary disk, out of which Earth and other Solar System bodies formed.
<br> The Solar System formed at least 4.568 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a region within a large molecular cloud.
<br> This initial cloud was likely several light-years across and probably birthed several stars.
<br> As is typical of molecular clouds, this one consisted mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and small amounts of heavier 
<br> elements fused by previous generations of stars.
<br> As the pre-solar nebula collapsed, conservation of angular momentum caused it to rotate faster.
<br> The center, where most of the mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surroundings.
<br> As the contracting nebula spun faster, it began to flatten into a protoplanetary disc with a diameter of roughly 200 AU and a hot,
<br> dense protostar at the center.</p>
<p><br> planets formed by accretion from this disc,in which dust and gas gravitationally attracted each other,
<br> coalescing to form ever larger bodies.
<br> Hundreds of protoplanets may have existed in the early Solar System, but they either merged or were destroyed or ejected, 
<br> leaving the planets, dwarf planets, and leftover minor bodies.
<br> Due to their higher boiling points, only metals and silicates could exist in solid form in the warm inner Solar System close to the Sun (within the frost line).
<br> They eventually formed the rocky planets of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Because these refractory materials only comprised
<br> a small fraction of the solar nebula, the terrestrial planets could not grow very large.
<br> The giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed further out, beyond the frost line, the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter
<br> where material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid.</p>
<p>
<br> The ices that formed these planets were more plentiful than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial inner planets, allowing them to grow massive 
<br> enough to capture large atmospheres of hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most abundant elements.
<br> Leftover debris that never became planets congregated in regions such as the asteroid belt, Kuiper belt, and Oort cloud.
<br> Within 50 million years, the pressure and density of hydrogen in the center of the protostar became great enough for it to begin thermonuclear fusion.
<br> As helium accumulates at its core, the Sun is growing brighter; early in its main-sequence life its brightness was 70% that of what it is today.
<br> The temperature, reaction rate, pressure, and density increased until hydrostatic equilibrium was achieved: the thermal pressure counterbalancing the force of gravity. </p>
<br> At this point, the Sun became a main-sequence star. Solar wind from the Sun created the heliosphere and swept away the remaining gas and dust 
<br> from the protoplanetary disc into interstellar space.
<br> Following the dissipation of the protoplanetary disk, the Nice model proposes that gravitational encounters between planetisimals and the
<br> gas giants caused each to migrate into different orbits.
<br> This led to dynamical instability of the entire system, which scattered the planetisimals and ultimately placed the gas giants in their current positions.
<br> During this period, the grand tack hypothesis suggests that a final inward migration of Jupiter dispersed much of the asteroid belt, 
<br> leading to the Late Heavy Bombardment of the inner planets.

<h2>INNER PLANETS</h2>

<p>The first four planets from the Sun are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. 
<br>These inner planets also are known as terrestrial planets because they have solid surfaces.<br>

<h2> MERCURY</h2>
<p> Mercury is the planet nearest to the Sun, and the smallest planet in our solar system.<br>
