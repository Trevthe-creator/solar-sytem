Mercedes-Benz (German pronunciation: [mɛʁˈtseːdəs ˈbɛnts]) is a brand of cars, trucks, buses and coaches from the Daimler AG company of Germany. <br>The company was once known as Daimler-Benz and is still sometimes called just "Mercedes." <br>Mercedes-Benz is one of the world's oldest car maker and the cars they make are expensive. <br>The symbol of Mercedes-Benz is very famous. It is a three-pointed star inside of a circle and was designed by one of the men who started the company, Gottlieb Daimler. <br>The three points of the star stand for land, air and sea because Daimler's engines were used not only in cars and trucks but in airplanes and boats. <br>The symbol was first used in 1909.
Mercedes-Benz cars are an important part of the history of the car with many "firsts”. <br>They were the first to build a diesel-powered car in the 1930s, the first to build a car with fuel injection in the 1950s and the first to offer antilock brakes in the 1970s.<br> Mercedes-Benz cars have also been important in auto racing history.</p>
